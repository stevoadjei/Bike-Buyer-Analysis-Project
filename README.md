# Bike-Buyer-Analysis-Project
# 1. Project Overview and Business Questions (The "Why")
# Project Goal
The primary objective of this project was to analyse the provided bike-buyer dataset to identify the key demographic and behavioural segments most likely to purchase a bicycle. This analysis aims to provide actionable insights into marketing and sales strategies.
# Core Business Questions
The analysis was structured to answer the following key questions:<br>
•	How does a potential buyer's age influence their decision to purchase a bike? <br>
•	Is there a correlation between income and the likelihood of purchasing a bike?<br>
•	Do different commute distances show varying rates of bike purchases?<br>
•	How do marital status and gender relate to the purchasing decision?<br>

# 2. Data Source and Preparation (The "What" and "How") <br>
2.1 Data Source <br>
The analysis was performed on the: <a href= "https://github.com/stevoadjei/Bike-Buyer-Analysis-Project/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx">bike dataset download</a> <br>
2.2 Data Cleaning and Transformation <br>
The raw data underwent several critical cleaning and transformation steps to ensure accuracy and clarity for analysis. <br>

2.3 Feature Engineering Details: Age Bracket  <br>
The original Age column was grouped into the following categorical brackets for better visualization of purchasing trends: <br>
•	ADOLESCENCE <br>
•	MIDDLE AGE <br>
•	OLD <br>

# 3. Data Analysis and Findings (The "What We Found")   <br>
The analysis was performed using Pivot Tables 8 to summarize the raw data across key variables and calculate the purchasing rate of a bike ("Purchased Bike" = Yes) by each segment.  <br>
3.1 Bike Purchase by Age Bracket  <br>

3.2 Bike Purchase by Commute Distance  <br>
The analysis of commute distance reveals insights into lifestyle and functional needs for a bike. <br>

3.3 Average Income by Purchase Decision and Gender  <br>
This table provides the average income for buyers versus non-buyers, segmented by gender. The Income column was correctly formatted as currency in the data preparation phase.<br>

# 4. Final Deliverables and Next Steps  <br>
4.1 Dashboard and Visualization  <br>
A dashboard was created to consolidate the insights, utilizing slicers to allow interactive filtering of the data based on various segments (e.g., instantly filter the average income by age bracket). <br>
4.2 Conclusion and Actionable Insights  <br>
The data analysis clearly identifies the optimal target demographic for bike purchasing:  <br>
•	Target Demographic: The most profitable segment is the Middle Age bracket (highest volume of purchases) with an average income of approximately $72,105. <br>
•	Key Behavioral Indicator: Individuals with commute distances of 1-2 miles and 5-10 miles represent the largest purchasing groups, suggesting that the bicycle is primarily being purchased for commuting purposes. <br>
•	Marketing Strategy: Marketing campaigns should focus on the "Middle Age" demographic and emphasize the convenience and cost-saving benefits of cycling for commutes between 1 and 10 miles. <br>
