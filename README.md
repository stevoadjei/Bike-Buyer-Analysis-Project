# Bike-Buyer-Analysis-Project
# 1. Project Overview and Business Questions (The "Why")
# Project Goal
The primary objective of this project was to analyse the provided bike-buyer dataset to identify the key demographic and behavioural segments most likely to purchase a bicycle. This analysis aims to provide actionable insights into marketing and sales strategies.
# Core Business Questions
The analysis was structured to answer the following key questions:<br>
•	How does a potential buyer's age influence their decision to purchase a bike? <br>
•	Is there a correlation between income and the likelihood of purchasing a bike?<br>
•	Do different commute distances show varying rates of bike purchases?<br>
•	How do marital status and gender relate to the purchasing decision?<br>

# 2. Data Source and Preparation (The "What" and "How")
2.1 Data Source <br>
The analysis was performed on the: <a href= "https://github.com/stevoadjei/Bike-Buyer-Analysis-Project/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx">bike dataset download</a> <br>
2.2 Data Cleaning and Transformation <br>

2.3 Feature Engineering Details: Age Bracket
The original Age column was grouped into the following categorical brackets for better visualization of purchasing trends:
•	ADOLESCENCE
•	MIDDLE AGE
•	OLD

3. Data Analysis and Findings (The "What We Found")
The analysis was performed using Pivot Tables 8 to summarize the raw data across key variables and calculate the purchasing rate of a bike ("Purchased Bike" = Yes) by each segment.
